## Quarto setup

Follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/example-01-basics.md#github-pages) from the [`quarto-actions` repo](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions).
In the [YAML file](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/quarto-publish-example.yml), don't forget to install Python, [Julia](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/example-03-dependencies.md#installing-julia), and [Jupyter](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/example-03-dependencies.md#installing-jupyter) too (even if your notebook uses the pure Julia engine).
